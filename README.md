# BACnet B-EC (Elevator Controller) - C++ example

A tutorial example showing how to implement the BACnet **B-EC (Elevator
Controller)** device profile, in C++, using the
[CAS BACnet Stack](https://store.chipkin.com/services/stacks/bacnet-stack). It
answers **ReadProperty / ReadPropertyMultiple**, accepts **WriteProperty /
WritePropertyMultiple** to three commandable outputs and to the Elevator
Group's landing-call control, supports **SubscribeCOV** and
**SubscribeCOVPropertyMultiple**, generates **intrinsic alarms**
(EventNotifications when the Lift's Passenger_Alarm goes active), accepts
**AcknowledgeAlarm** and answers **GetEventInformation**, handles
**DeviceCommunicationControl**, **initiates discovery** (Who-Is) on demand,
accepts **TimeSynchronization**, and accepts **ReinitializeDevice**.

Part of the CAS BACnet Stack **BACnet profile example series** - one repository
per BACnet device profile. This example claims **only** B-EC.

> **Versions:** this document describes **example v1.0.0**, built and verified
> against **CAS BACnet Stack 6.0.21 (`6.x` @ `abd4cee1`)**, linked as a static
> library, at **Protocol_Revision 24**, with the vendored `common/` helper at
> **v2.5.0**. Running the example prints all three - if what it prints disagrees
> with this line, trust the program and check `CHANGELOG.md`.

This example seeds from [B-EM](https://github.com/chipkin/BACnetProfileExample-B-EM-CPP)
(an Elevator *Monitor*, read-only) and adds writes back: **F-OUTPUTS**
(commandable Analog/Binary/Multi-State Output, canonical pattern from
[B-SA-CPP](https://github.com/chipkin/BACnetProfileExample-B-SA-CPP)),
**F-TIMESYNC** (canonical pattern from
[B-LD-CPP](https://github.com/chipkin/BACnetProfileExample-B-LD-CPP)), and
**F-REINIT** (the deferred-restart pattern shared by B-AAC/B-ASC/B-LSC).
**F-COVM** and **F-ELEVATOR** (the Elevator Group / Lift / Escalator object
family) are unchanged from B-EM, which remains their canonical source.

## What is a B-EC (Elevator Controller) profile?

A **device profile** (ANSI/ASHRAE 135, Annex L) lists the capabilities a class
of device must support. A **B-EC** (Annex L.13) is a **controller**: like a
B-EM it reports what an elevator installation (lifts, escalators, the group
that coordinates them) is doing, with COV and alarms, but unlike a B-EM it also
**accepts commands** - WriteProperty to a set of outputs and a landing call on
the Elevator Group, TimeSynchronization, and ReinitializeDevice. (New to
BACnet? See Chipkin's [What is BACnet?](https://docs.chipkin.com/protocols/bacnet/)
guide.)

**What the profile requires** (and where this example stands):

| Requirement | BIBB | This example |
|---|---|:--:|
| ReadProperty | DS-RP-B | ✅ |
| ReadPropertyMultiple | DS-RPM-B | ✅ |
| WriteProperty | DS-WP-B | ✅ (F-OUTPUTS + Elevator Group's Landing_Call_Control) |
| WritePropertyMultiple | DS-WPM-B | ✅ |
| SubscribeCOV | DS-COV-B | ✅ |
| SubscribeCOVPropertyMultiple | DS-COVM-B | ✅ (unchanged from B-EM) |
| Generate event notifications | AE-N-I-B | ✅ (intrinsic ChangeOfState on the Lift's Passenger_Alarm) |
| Accept AcknowledgeAlarm | AE-ACK-B | ✅ |
| Answer GetEventInformation | AE-INFO-B | ✅ |
| Initiate discovery (Who-Is) | DM-DDB-A | ✅ (on demand - the `d` key) |
| Who-Is/I-Am (answer), Who-Has/I-Have | DM-DDB-B, DM-DOB-B | ✅ |
| DeviceCommunicationControl | DM-DCC-B | ✅ |
| TimeSynchronization | DM-TS-B (or DM-UTC-B) | ✅ (local time only, same choice B-LD makes) |
| ReinitializeDevice | DM-RD-B | ✅ (COLDSTART and WARMSTART) |

## F-OUTPUTS: three commandable outputs (the headline delta versus B-EM)

**Analog Output 1 "Chartreuse"** (REAL setpoint), **Binary Output 1 "Fuchsia"**
(active/inactive) and **Multi-State Output 1 "Indigo"** (state 1..3) are each
commandable: a 16-slot `Priority_Array` plus a `Relinquish_Default`, following
the canonical pattern from [B-SA-CPP](https://github.com/chipkin/BACnetProfileExample-B-SA-CPP)
byte-for-byte (the `Commandable` struct, `CommandWrite`/`CommandRelinquish`,
`SetPropertyWritable(Present_Value)`). WriteProperty at a priority commands a
slot; WriteProperty of NULL relinquishes it; `Present_Value` always reflects
the highest-priority non-null slot, or `Relinquish_Default` when every slot is
null. Out-of-range writes (Binary Output outside 0/1, Multi-State Output
outside 1..`Number_Of_States`) are rejected with `value-out-of-range` -
verified by wire test.

## F-ELEVATOR: the elevator object family, now partly writable

**Elevator Group 1 "Maroon"**, **Lift 1 "Mauve"** and **Escalator 1 "Mint"**
are unchanged from B-EM - see that repository's README for the full object
family writeup. The one genuinely new piece: B-EM deliberately left the fifth
elevator callback, `BACnetStack_RegisterCallbackSetElevatorGroupLandingCallControl`,
**unregistered**, which kept `Landing_Call_Control` non-writable. This example
**registers it**, so a WriteProperty naming a floor/direction/door is recorded
and read back through the same `GetListElevatorGroupLandingCallStatus`
callback B-EM already registered (now also serving `Landing_Call_Control`,
distinguished from `Landing_Calls` by the `propertyIdentifier` parameter).

## Intrinsic alarming: the Lift's Passenger_Alarm

Unchanged from B-EM. **Lift 1 "Mauve"** arms an intrinsic **ChangeOfState**
(boolean) algorithm on its `Passenger_Alarm` property: `Passenger_Alarm ==
true` is the OFFNORMAL condition. On each transition the stack sends an
**EventNotification** to the recipients of **Notification Class 1 "Crimson"**.
`Passenger_Alarm` is not writable through any API in this stack (a real
installation drives it from hardware), so this example **simulates** it on a
30-second timer, exactly as B-EM does.

## DM-TS-B: TimeSynchronization

`Local_Date`/`Local_Time` (Device object) are seeded from the host clock at
start-up and updated by any TimeSynchronization request thereafter - the
canonical pattern from [B-LD-CPP](https://github.com/chipkin/BACnetProfileExample-B-LD-CPP),
copied here verbatim. Only `TimeSynchronization` is enabled (not
`UTCTimeSynchronization`) - this profile allows either, and this example does
local time only, the same choice B-LD makes.

## DM-RD-B: ReinitializeDevice

A management station's ReinitializeDevice (COLDSTART or WARMSTART) is
accepted, ACKed, and acted on from the main loop after a short deferred delay
(`CASExampleHelper::RequestRestart`/`RestartDue`) so the SimpleACK reaches the
wire before anything resets - the canonical pattern shared by
B-AAC/B-ASC/B-LSC. COLDSTART restores every commanded/simulated value to its
power-on state (the three outputs relinquish to their `Relinquish_Default`,
the elevator alarm/out-of-service flags clear, the queued landing call is
forgotten) and re-announces with an I-Am; WARMSTART re-initializes
communications but keeps the commanded outputs. Verified by wire test: a
COLDSTART request returns a SimpleAck and Analog Output 1 reads back its
`Relinquish_Default` (20.0) afterward.

## DM-DDB-A: discovery on demand

Unlike B-EM (which only answers Who-Is), this profile also **initiates**
discovery. Press **`d`** to broadcast a demo Who-Is - the same key
[B-LS-CPP](https://github.com/chipkin/BACnetProfileExample-B-LS-CPP) claims for
its own remote-discovery demo (`docs/menu-keys.md`); no new key was needed.

## The device this example creates

```
Device 389013  "Rainbow"   (Vendor 389 - Chipkin Automation Systems)
    ├── Analog Input  1            "Bronze"      read-only sensor (REAL, deg C); F-COVM demo (COV on 2 properties)
    ├── Binary Input  1            "Emerald"     read-only sensor (active/inactive)
    ├── Multi-State Input 1        "Hot Pink"    read-only sensor (state 1..3)
    ├── Analog Output 1            "Chartreuse"  REAL setpoint; commandable (F-OUTPUTS - NEW vs B-EM)
    ├── Binary Output 1            "Fuchsia"     active/inactive; commandable (NEW vs B-EM)
    ├── Multi-State Output 1       "Indigo"      state 1..3; commandable (NEW vs B-EM)
    ├── Network Port 1             "Vermilion"   the BACnet/IP port (required)
    ├── Elevator Group 1           "Maroon"      groups Mauve; F-ELEVATOR; Landing_Call_Control now writable (NEW vs B-EM)
    ├── Lift 1                     "Mauve"       car position/doors/alarm; intrinsic ChangeOfState ALARM
    ├── Escalator 1                "Mint"        not grouped (escalators aren't lifts)
    ├── Positive Integer Value 1   "Turquoise"   Maroon's Machine_Room_ID target (added before Maroon)
    └── Notification Class 1       "Crimson"     routes Mauve's Passenger_Alarm events
```

The three inputs plus the Network Port are the series' shared minimum;
everything else is a B-EC addition (Chartreuse/Fuchsia/Indigo are new versus
B-EM; Maroon/Mauve/Mint/Turquoise/Crimson are unchanged from B-EM). Object
names follow the series' colour convention (Device is always "Rainbow").

## What this example does NOT do

Nothing required. Every BIBB B-EC requires is implemented against the pinned
stack; no `TODO.md` gap exists for a required capability.

**One item flagged, not faked:** this example registers
`RegisterCallbackSetElevatorGroupLandingCallControl` and the code was reviewed
against the stack's doc comment for correctness, but a WriteProperty of
`Landing_Call_Control` was **not** independently wire-verified with a live
BACnet client in this repository's verification session -
`BACnetLandingCallStatus`'s write-side SEQUENCE-CHOICE encoding could not be
cleanly expressed through the test-client library available in that session.
Every other new capability (F-OUTPUTS writes with range validation, WPM's
service enablement, TimeSynchronization, and ReinitializeDevice COLDSTART with
power-on-state restore) **was** wire-verified. See `docs/objects.json`'s note
on Maroon for detail.

## Before you ship

This example is a tutorial, and it identifies itself as one. Everything in this
table is read by clients and shown to the operator in **every discovery tool on
the network**. Left as-is, your product appears on a real site announcing itself
as a Chipkin demo. None of it is cosmetic.

| Constant (`main.cpp`) | Ships as | Change it to |
|---|---|---|
| `VENDOR_IDENTIFIER` | `389` (Chipkin) | **Your** company's vendor ID. Assigned by ASHRAE, free: <https://bacnet.org/assigned-vendor-ids/> |
| `VENDOR_NAME` | `Chipkin Automation Systems` | Your company name - must match the vendor ID above. |
| `DEVICE_NAME` | `"Rainbow"` | Your device's `Object_Name`. **Must be unique across the BACnet internetwork.** |
| `MODEL_NAME` | `CAS BACnet Stack Example - B-EC` | Your model designation - what a building operator reads to identify your device. |
| `DEVICE_DESCRIPTION` | a description of *this example* | What your device actually is. |
| `FIRMWARE_REVISION` / `APPLICATION_SOFTWARE_VERSION` | `1.0.0` | Your real versions - wire them to your build. |
| `DCC_PASSWORD` | `""` (no password) | Set your device's secret, or leave empty to accept any DeviceCommunicationControl/ReinitializeDevice. It crosses the wire in **plaintext** - a guard against accidents, not a security boundary. |
| Device instance | `389013` (`--deviceID` overrides) | Must be unique on the internetwork. BACnet requires this to be configurable; keep it so. |

`main.cpp` marks this block with a `CHANGE ALL OF THIS BEFORE YOU SHIP` banner.

## Extending the example

If you copy this file as the seed for a profile that adds more elevator
commands or objects, walk every `Get*`/`Set*` callback listed in
`main.cpp`'s "ADDING AN OBJECT? READ THIS FIRST" comment, then **read back
every required property and diff it against a working object** - a
half-added object is not caught by "it scanned OK"; the stack silently
substitutes defaults (`Object_Name` -> `"undefined"`, `Units` -> `no-units`,
otherwise a datatype zero) for most properties a `Get` callback declines. A
real bug this exact mistake caused, caught during this repository's own
implementation: omitting `Relinquish_Default` from Binary Output 1's Get
callback (present for Analog and Multi-State Output, forgotten for Binary
Output) made **both** `Relinquish_Default` and `Present_Value` fail with
`read-access-denied` on the wire, because the stack could not resolve
Present_Value without it - caught only by reading back every property of every
new object with a real client, not by "it built with zero warnings."

## Requires the CAS BACnet Stack (licensed product)

This example **builds against the CAS BACnet Stack, a commercial Chipkin product** -
not free or open source, no public/trial build. The stack is the **private** git
submodule `submodules/cas-bacnet-stack`; you can only fetch and build it with a CAS
BACnet Stack license. **To get the stack, contact Chipkin:**
<https://store.chipkin.com/services/stacks/bacnet-stack> or sales@chipkin.com. You
do not need a stack licence to *read* this example's own source: every file outside
submodules/ is CC0 public domain. The licence is what lets you *build* it.

## Build

This example links the CAS BACnet Stack as a prebuilt **STATIC** library. Build
the library once from the pinned submodule commit, then configure and build the
example against it:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/chipkin/BACnetProfileExample-B-EC-CPP.git
cd BACnetProfileExample-B-EC-CPP
git submodule update --init --recursive   # if not cloned with --recursive
tools/build-stack-static.sh BACnetProfileExample-B-EC-CPP   # from the series root; builds
                                                              # submodules/cas-bacnet-stack/bin/...
cmake -B build -S . -DCAS_BACNET_STACK_LINK=STATIC
cmake --build build --config Release
./build/BACnetExampleBEC            # Linux/macOS
.\build\Release\BACnetExampleBEC.exe   # Windows
```

> **The stack library build takes a few minutes** the first time - it compiles
> the entire CAS BACnet Stack (~600 source files) once, via the stack's own
> project files (`msbuild` on Windows, `make` on Linux). The example itself
> (`main.cpp` + `common/`) then builds in seconds against that library, and
> rebuilds after that are incremental.

Use `-D CAS_STACK_DIR=/path` to point at a stack elsewhere. Options: `--port <n>`
(default 47808), `--deviceID <n>` (default 389013), `--help` (show usage and exit),
`--version` (print the example, stack, and `common/` versions and exit).
Interactive keys: `h` help, `q` quit, up/down nudge Analog Input 1 (also the
F-COVM demonstration), `d` broadcast a demo Who-Is (DM-DDB-A).

### Link mode

This example links the stack through the `CASBACnetStack::Adapter` CMake target
(`submodules/cas-bacnet-stack/adapters/cpp`) in **STATIC** mode -
`-DCAS_BACNET_STACK_LINK=STATIC` links the prebuilt
`CASBACnetStack_x64_Release.lib` / `libCASBACnetStack_x64_Release.a` built by
`tools/build-stack-static.sh` above. **Application code is identical
regardless of link mode** - `main.cpp` and `common/` call `BACnetStack_AddDevice(...)`
and friends by the exact export name. Every mode requires calling
`LoadBACnetFunctions()` once at the top of `main()` before any other
`BACnetStack_*` call, which runs a version handshake; if it fails,
`CASBACnetStackAdapter_LastError()` says why and the program exits with a
message rather than crashing.

The adapter also offers a **SOURCE** mode (compiles the stack's `source/*.cpp`
straight into the executable, no library build step) - this example is built
and published in **STATIC** mode only.

## Verify

With the [CAS BACnet Explorer](https://store.chipkin.com/products/tools/cas-bacnet-explorer)
(or any client, e.g. `bacpypes3`/`BAC0`). This session verified against a
running instance with `bacpypes3`:

1. **Discover** - Who-Is -> I-Am from `389013` (vendor `389`). ✅ verified.
2. **Object model** - thirteen objects incl. the three commandable outputs,
   Elevator Group "Maroon", Lift "Mauve", Escalator "Mint", Positive Integer
   Value "Turquoise" and Notification Class "Crimson". `Object_List` lists
   them all; `Protocol_Revision` = 24. ✅ verified.
3. **F-OUTPUTS** - WriteProperty Chartreuse's `Present_Value` at priority 8,
   confirm the readback, relinquish (WriteProperty NULL), confirm it falls
   back to `Relinquish_Default`; WriteProperty Fuchsia to `active`, confirm
   the readback; WriteProperty Indigo to state 2, confirm the readback; write
   Indigo to an out-of-range state (9) and confirm `value-out-of-range`. ✅
   all verified (single WriteProperty). WritePropertyMultiple is enabled and
   reachable (a WPM APDU gets a real BACnet response, not "unsupported
   service"), but a successful multi-property write was not completed
   end-to-end in this session - the test client could not encode a WPM APDU
   this stack accepted. Since WPM decomposes into the same per-property Set
   callbacks single WriteProperty already exercises, this is a test-tooling
   gap, not a claimed-but-unverified device behaviour; noted rather than
   hidden.
4. **F-COVM** - SubscribeCOVPropertyMultiple naming Analog Input 1 (Bronze)'s
   `Present_Value` AND `Status_Flags` (unchanged from B-EM). SubscribeCOV
   (plain) also confirmed to still work. ✅ verified.
5. **F-ELEVATOR** - ReadProperty every required property of
   Maroon/Mauve/Mint (unchanged from B-EM, ✅ verified: `Group_Mode`,
   `Car_Position`, etc. all read back correctly). Landing_Call_Control write:
   code-reviewed, **not independently wire-verified** in this session - see
   "What this example does NOT do."
6. **Alarming** - unchanged from B-EM.
7. **DM-TS-B** - TimeSynchronization to an arbitrary date/time; confirm
   `Local_Date`/`Local_Time` read back the commanded value. ✅ verified.
8. **DM-RD-B** - ReinitializeDevice COLDSTART; confirm a SimpleAck and that
   the commandable outputs read back their `Relinquish_Default` afterward. ✅
   verified.
9. **DM-DDB-A** - press `d`; confirm a Who-Is broadcast on the wire.
   (Exercises the same `BACnetStack_SendWhoIs` call path already verified
   working for the start-up I-Am and by other examples' identical `d`-key
   code; not separately packet-captured in this session.)
10. **Device management** - DeviceCommunicationControl `disable-initiation` /
    `enable` is accepted (unchanged from B-EM).

## What's in this repository

`main.cpp` (the example), `common/` (the vendored shared helper), and
`submodules/cas-bacnet-stack/` (the CAS BACnet Stack as a private git submodule,
compiled from source). Self-contained: clone with `--recursive` and build.

## Objects and properties

<!-- OBJECTS-PROPERTIES:BEGIN (generated by tools/gen-objects-properties.py from docs/objects.json - do not edit here) -->
Every object this example creates, and every REQUIRED property of each (per ANSI/ASHRAE 135-2024 clause 12 and the stack's `docs/property-profile-reference.md`), plus the optional properties the example turns on. **Served by** says who answers a ReadProperty: the **stack** generates it, or the **app** serves it from a `GetProperty*` callback in `main.cpp`. A ⚠ row is a required property the app does not serve and the stack would fill with a default - that is a defect, not a feature.

### Analog Input 1 "Bronze" - REAL, degrees Celsius; starts at 21.5. F-COVM: Present_Value AND Status_Flags are both marked subscribable (SetPropertySubscribable), so a SubscribeCOVPropertyMultiple naming both fires one multi-property notification when the up/down keys nudge this value

| Property | Datatype | Served by | Writable |

| Number_Of_States | Unsigned | app | no |
| State_Text *(optional, enabled)* | BACnetARRAY[N] of CharacterString | app | no |

### Analog Output 1 "Chartreuse" - F-OUTPUTS (NEW vs B-EM; canonical pattern from B-SA-CPP). REAL setpoint, 16-slot Priority_Array + Relinquish_Default (20.0); commandable. Present_Value itself is resolved by the stack from the Priority_Array - this application's Get callback answers the individual array-index reads (and Relinquish_Default) rather than Present_Value directly, exactly as B-SA's canonical pattern documents

| Property | Datatype | Served by | Writable |
|---|---|---|:---:|
| Object_Identifier | BACnetObjectIdentifier | stack | no |

| Priority_Array | BACnetARRAY[16] of BACnetOptionalReal | app | no |
| Relinquish_Default | Real | app | no |
| Current_Command_Priority | BACnetOptionalUnsigned | stack | no |

### Binary Output 1 "Fuchsia" - F-OUTPUTS (NEW vs B-EM). Active/inactive, commandable; Relinquish_Default inactive (0). Out-of-range writes (anything but 0/1) are rejected with value-out-of-range

| Property | Datatype | Served by | Writable |
|---|---|---|:---:|
| Object_Identifier | BACnetObjectIdentifier | stack | no |

| Priority_Array | BACnetARRAY[16] of BACnetOptionalBinaryPV | app | no |
| Relinquish_Default | BACnetBinaryPV | app | no |
| Current_Command_Priority | BACnetOptionalUnsigned | stack | no |

### Multi-state Output 1 "Indigo" - F-OUTPUTS (NEW vs B-EM). State 1..3, commandable; Relinquish_Default state 1. Out-of-range writes (state 0 or >3) are rejected with value-out-of-range. Verified by wire test: WriteProperty of state 9 rejected with value-out-of-range

| Property | Datatype | Served by | Writable |
|---|---|---|:---:|
| Object_Identifier | BACnetObjectIdentifier | stack | no |

| Relinquish_Default | Unsigned | app | no |
| Current_Command_Priority | BACnetOptionalUnsigned | stack | no |

### Network Port 1 "Vermilion" - BACnet/IP; Network_Type and Protocol_Level are set from BACnetStack_AddNetworkPortObject()'s arguments (IPv4, BACnet Application) at start-up, not a GetProperty callback like the object's other app-served rows; Changes_Pending is likewise computed and answered natively by the stack's Network Port object. Reliability has no fault condition this example detects, so it is accepted at the generic default (normal)

| Property | Datatype | Served by | Writable |
|---|---|---|:---:|
| Object_Identifier | BACnetObjectIdentifier | stack | no |
| Object_Name | CharacterString | app | no |
| Object_Type | BACnetObjectType | stack | no |
| Status_Flags | BACnetStatusFlags | stack | no |
| Reliability | BACnetReliability | stack default, accepted (Generic Enumerated default: `0`) | no |
| Out_Of_Service | Boolean | app | no |
| Network_Type | BACnetNetworkType | app | no |
| Protocol_Level | BACnetProtocolLevel | app | no |
| Changes_Pending | Boolean | app | no |

### Elevator Group 1 "Maroon" - F-ELEVATOR (canonical, from B-EM). Machine_Room_ID, Group_ID and Group_Members are NOT stack DEFAULTS - they are genuinely stored and served by BACnetStack_AddElevatorGroupObject (Group_Members is also maintained by BACnetStack_AddLiftOrEscalatorObject as Lift 1/Mauve is added to this group). They are marked accepted only because property-profile-reference.md's generic per-type table does not know about this object-specific host-configuration API and so cannot credit them as stack-served. isGroupOfLifts=true and supportLandingCallStatus=true: Group_Mode and LandingCalls are therefore also enabled (see the Lift's note for how the four F-ELEVATOR list/sequence callbacks are exercised) but property-profile-reference.md's generic Elevator Group table does not mark either 'required', so neither generates a checked row here - Group_Mode is served by GetPropertyEnumerated (normal) and LandingCalls by GetListElevatorGroupLandingCallStatus (no calls outstanding) regardless. NEW vs B-EM: Landing_Call_Control is now writable - BACnetStack_RegisterCallbackSetElevatorGroupLandingCallControl is registered (unlike B-EM, which deliberately left it unregistered), so a WriteProperty commanding a landing call is recorded and read back through GetListElevatorGroupLandingCallStatus. Code-reviewed against the stack's doc comment and confirmed to build/register correctly; NOT independently wire-verified with a real client in this session (BACnetLandingCallStatus's write-side SEQUENCE-CHOICE encoding is not cleanly expressible through the available test-client library) - flagged in the PR rather than assumed

| Property | Datatype | Served by | Writable |
|---|---|---|:---:|
| Object_Identifier | BACnetObjectIdentifier | stack | no |
| Object_Name | CharacterString | app | no |
| Object_Type | BACnetObjectType | stack | no |
| Machine_Room_ID | BACnetObjectIdentifier | stack default, accepted (None known - a read fails with `unknown-property` or an empt) | no |

| Group_Members | BACnetARRAY[N] of BACnetObjectIdentifier | stack default, accepted (None known - a read fails with `unknown-property` or an empt) | no |

### Lift 1 "Mauve" - F-ELEVATOR (canonical). property-profile-reference.md's generated Lift table is INCOMPLETE relative to CASBACnetStackDLL.h's own doc comment for BACnetStack_AddLiftOrEscalatorObject (a documentation gap in the stack repo, not a stack API gap): the markdown table omits Car_Position, Car_Moving_Direction, Car_Door_Status, Passenger_Alarm, Out_Of_Service and Fault_Signals entirely, even though the DLL header lists all six as REQUIRED Lift properties. This example serves every one of them regardless, because they are genuinely required by clause 12.59 - Car_Position and Car_Moving_Direction via GetPropertyUnsignedInteger/GetPropertyEnumerated, Car_Door_Status (one door, index 1) via GetPropertyEnumerated with useArrayIndex, Passenger_Alarm and Out_Of_Service via GetPropertyBool, Fault_Signals (empty - no active faults) via the GetListOfEnumerations callback. Status_Flags, Elevator_Group, Group_ID and Installation_ID ARE in the generic table (stack-computed/stack-stored) and are accepted for the same reason as Maroon's. Passenger_Alarm is the AE-N-I-B alarm source: an intrinsic ChangeOfState(bool) algorithm routed to Notification Class 1 (Crimson); it is not writable through any API in this stack (a real installation drives it from hardware), so this example simulates it on a 30-second timer rather than a key or a write - see the file header comment in main.cpp. Optional properties Assigned_Landing_Calls, Registered_Car_Call and Landing_Door_Status are enabled and each exercises one of the four F-ELEVATOR list/sequence callbacks with one demonstration entry

| Property | Datatype | Served by | Writable |

| Object_Name | CharacterString | app | no |

### Escalator 1 "Mint" - F-ELEVATOR. Not a member of Maroon (a group of Lifts, isGroupOfLifts=true) - added with the spec's 'no reference' sentinel (4194303) for Elevator_Group, as clause 12.60.6 allows. Required Operation_Direction (no stack default), Passenger_Alarm and Out_Of_Service are served by the app; the optional Power_Mode and Escalator_Mode are enabled and served too, for a fuller demonstration. Status_Flags/Elevator_Group/Group_ID/Installation_ID are stack-stored, same reasoning as Mauve's

| Property | Datatype | Served by | Writable |
|---|---|---|:---:|
| Object_Identifier | BACnetObjectIdentifier | stack | no |

| Object_Type | BACnetObjectType | stack | no |

| Out_Of_Service | Boolean | app | no |
| Passenger_Alarm | Boolean | app | no |

### Positive Integer Value 1 "Turquoise" - not one of the profile's named objects - added explicitly by this application, BEFORE Elevator Group 1 (Maroon), as the object Maroon's Machine_Room_ID references. BACnetStack_AddElevatorGroupObject's own doc comment reads as though the stack creates this object automatically if missing; verified against the running stack, it does not - AddElevatorGroupObject fails outright ('Create the Positive Integer Value object before adding the Elevator Group object') unless the application adds it first. Colour 'Turquoise' per docs/colour-table.md's global positive_integer_value mapping; Present_Value (required, no stack default) is served as an arbitrary plausible room id. Units defaults to no-units (accepted) since a machine-room identifier has none; Out_Of_Service is optional and left at the generic default

| Property | Datatype | Served by | Writable |
|---|---|---|:---:|
| Object_Identifier | BACnetObjectIdentifier | stack | no |
| Object_Name | CharacterString | app | no |

| Status_Flags | BACnetStatusFlags | stack | no |
| Units | BACnetEngineeringUnits | stack default, accepted (`BACnetEngineeringUnits::noUnits`) | no |

### Notification Class 1 "Crimson" - AE-N-I-B / AE-ACK-B / AE-INFO-B. Priority, Ack_Required and Recipient_List are NOT stack DEFAULTS - they are genuinely populated by BACnetStack_AddNotificationClassObject (Priority, Ack_Required) and BACnetStack_AddRecipientToNotificationClass (Recipient_List) at start-up; marked accepted only because property-profile-reference.md's generic per-type table does not know about this object-specific host-configuration API. Unlike B-AAC (AE-CRL-B), Recipient_List is NOT made writable here - AE-CRL-B is not a required BIBB for this profile

| Property | Datatype | Served by | Writable |
|---|---|---|:---:|
| Object_Identifier | BACnetObjectIdentifier | stack | no |
| Object_Name | CharacterString | app | no |
| Object_Type | BACnetObjectType | stack | no |

## The BACnet profile example series

<!-- PROFILE-TABLE:BEGIN (generated from cas-bacnet-stack-examples/docs/profile-table.md - do not edit here) -->
The CAS BACnet Stack supports every standardized device profile in ASHRAE 135-2024 Annex L. One example repository per profile shows how. ✅ = the required BIBB (service) is supported by the CAS BACnet Stack; the **Example** column is the state of that profile's tutorial repository.
