## 1. Product description

| | |
|---|---|
| **Vendor Name** | Chipkin Automation Systems |
| **Vendor Identifier** | 389 |
| **Product Name** | CAS BACnet Stack Example - B-EC |
| **Product Model Number** | CAS BACnet Stack Example - B-EC |
| **Application Software Version** | 1.0.0 |
| **Firmware Revision** | 1.0.0 |
| **BACnet Protocol Version** | 1 |
| **BACnet Protocol Revision** | 24 |

**Product Description:** a BACnet/IP elevator controller built on the CAS
BACnet Stack. It reports what an elevator installation (an Elevator Group, a
Lift and an Escalator) is doing - the same object family as the B-EM (Elevator
Monitor) example - and, unlike a B-EM, also **accepts commands**: WriteProperty
to three commandable outputs and to the Elevator Group's landing-call control,
TimeSynchronization, and ReinitializeDevice. It generates intrinsic
ChangeOfState event notifications on the Lift's `Passenger_Alarm`, answers
ReadProperty/ReadPropertyMultiple for every required property of every object,
and is discoverable by Who-Is/I-Am and Who-Has/I-Have (and can also initiate a
Who-Is on demand). It is a tutorial for implementers of the B-EC profile.

## 2. BACnet standardized device profile (Annex L)

**B-EC - BACnet Elevator Controller.**

This device claims exactly one profile. Because the B-EC requirements are a
superset of B-GENERAL's, a conformant B-EC device also satisfies **B-GENERAL**
(Annex L.8); that is subsumption, not a second claim.

## 3. BIBBs supported (Annex K)

| BIBB | Description |
|---|---|
| DS-RP-B | Data Sharing - ReadProperty - B |
| DS-RPM-B | Data Sharing - ReadPropertyMultiple - B |
| DS-WP-B | Data Sharing - WriteProperty - B |
| DS-WPM-B | Data Sharing - WritePropertyMultiple - B |
| DS-COV-B | Data Sharing - COV - B |
| DS-COVM-B | Data Sharing - COV-Multiple - B |
| AE-N-I-B | Alarm and Event - Notification Internal - B |
| AE-ACK-B | Alarm and Event - ACK - B |
| AE-INFO-B | Alarm and Event - Information - B |
| DM-DDB-A | Device Management - Dynamic Device Binding - A |
| DM-DDB-B | Device Management - Dynamic Device Binding - B |
| DM-DOB-B | Device Management - Dynamic Object Binding - B |
| DM-DCC-B | Device Management - DeviceCommunicationControl - B |
| DM-TS-B | Device Management - TimeSynchronization - B |
| DM-RD-B | Device Management - ReinitializeDevice - B |

No other BIBBs are supported. In particular this device does **not** support
DM-UTC-B (this example synchronizes local time only, not UTC - see
`SERVICE_TIME_SYNCHRONIZATION` in `main.cpp`), AE-CRL-B (the Notification
Class's `Recipient_List` is not writable here), scheduling (SCHED-*), or
trending (T-*).

## 4. Application services supported

| Service | Initiate | Execute |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| ReadProperty | no | **yes** |
| ReadPropertyMultiple | no | **yes** |
| WriteProperty | no | **yes** |
| WritePropertyMultiple | no | **yes** |
| SubscribeCOV | no | **yes** |
| SubscribeCOVPropertyMultiple | no | **yes** |
| Who-Is | **yes** (on demand, press `d`) | **yes** |
| I-Am | **yes** | - |
| Who-Has | no | **yes** |
| I-Have | **yes** | - |
| ConfirmedEventNotification / UnconfirmedEventNotification | **yes** (intrinsic alarm) | no |
| AcknowledgeAlarm | no | **yes** |
| GetEventInformation | no | **yes** |
| DeviceCommunicationControl | no | **yes** |
| TimeSynchronization | no | **yes** |
| ReinitializeDevice | no | **yes** |

An unsolicited I-Am is broadcast to the local subnet at start-up, as well as in
response to Who-Is. Event notifications are sent (unconfirmed, to the local
subnet broadcast) when the Lift's intrinsic ChangeOfState algorithm transitions
- simulated on a 30-second timer, since `Passenger_Alarm` is not writable
through any API in this stack.

Any other confirmed service is rejected. That rejection is part of the
profile boundary, not a limitation to work around.

## 5. Segmentation capability

Segmentation is **not supported** in either direction
(`Segmentation_Supported` = `no-segmentation`). `Max_APDU_Length_Accepted` is
1476 octets, the BACnet/IP maximum.

## 6. Standard object types supported

No object is dynamically creatable or deletable. `Present_Value` of the three
Output objects, and `Landing_Call_Control` of the Elevator Group, are the only
writable properties on this device.

| Object type | Instance | Object_Name | Optional properties supported |
|---|:---:|---|---|
| Device | 389013 | Chipkin Example B-EC | Description |
| Analog Input | 1 | Bronze | - |
| Binary Input | 1 | Emerald | - |
| Multi-state Input | 1 | Hot Pink | State_Text |
| Analog Output | 1 | Chartreuse | - |
| Binary Output | 1 | Fuchsia | - |
| Multi-state Output | 1 | Indigo | - |
| Network Port | 1 | Vermilion | - |
| Elevator Group | 1 | Maroon | - |
| Lift | 1 | Mauve | Assigned_Landing_Calls, Registered_Car_Call, Landing_Door_Status |
| Escalator | 1 | Mint | Power_Mode, Escalator_Mode |
| Positive Integer Value | 1 | Turquoise | - |
| Notification Class | 1 | Crimson | - |

The device instance is configurable at run time with `--deviceID` (BACnet
requires the device instance to be configurable).

## 7. Data link layer options

**BACnet/IP (Annex J)**, UDP port 47808 (0xBAC0) by default, configurable at run
time with `--port`.

BBMD is not supported, Foreign Device registration is not supported, and
BACnet/SC, MS/TP, Ethernet (Annex H) and PTP are not supported.

## 8. Device address binding

Static device binding is **not supported**. This device answers Who-Is/Who-Has
and does not initiate any confirmed request to a peer that would require one
(its own Who-Is, DM-DDB-A, is unconfirmed and does not bind an address).

## 9. Networking options

None. The device is not a router, not a BBMD, and does not register as a
foreign device.

## 10. Character sets supported

UTF-8 (ANSI X3.4). Supporting a character set does not imply the device can
handle data in all character sets.

## 11. Objects and properties

<!-- OBJECTS-PROPERTIES:BEGIN (generated by tools/gen-objects-properties.py from docs/objects.json - do not edit here) -->
Every object this example creates, and every REQUIRED property of each (per ANSI/ASHRAE 135-2024 clause 12 and the stack's `docs/property-profile-reference.md`), plus the optional properties the example turns on. **Served by** says who answers a ReadProperty: the **stack** generates it, or the **app** serves it from a `GetProperty*` callback in `main.cpp`. A ⚠ row is a required property the app does not serve and the stack would fill with a default - that is a defect, not a feature.

### Device 389013 "Chipkin Example B-EC" - the device itself; the instance is configurable with --deviceID. The stack rows are device-wide facts only the stack knows - the protocol version and revision it implements, the services and object types it was configured with, the live object list and address-binding table. The accepted rows are the stack's configured defaults for APDU limits, segmentation, system status and database revision; an application that answered them from its own constants could contradict the stack, so this example does not

### Analog Output 1 "Chartreuse" - F-OUTPUTS (NEW vs B-EM; canonical pattern from B-SA-CPP). REAL setpoint, 16-slot Priority_Array + Relinquish_Default (20.0); commandable. Present_Value itself is resolved by the stack from the Priority_Array - this application's Get callback answers the individual array-index reads (and Relinquish_Default) rather than Present_Value directly, exactly as B-SA's canonical pattern documents

### Binary Output 1 "Fuchsia" - F-OUTPUTS (NEW vs B-EM). Active/inactive, commandable; Relinquish_Default inactive (0). Out-of-range writes (anything but 0/1) are rejected with value-out-of-range

### Network Port 1 "Vermilion" - BACnet/IP; Network_Type and Protocol_Level are set from BACnetStack_AddNetworkPortObject()'s arguments (IPv4, BACnet Application) at start-up, not a GetProperty callback like the object's other app-served rows; Changes_Pending is likewise computed and answered natively by the stack's Network Port object. Reliability has no fault condition this example detects, so it is accepted at the generic default (normal)

### Elevator Group 1 "Maroon" - F-ELEVATOR (canonical, from B-EM). Machine_Room_ID, Group_ID and Group_Members are NOT stack DEFAULTS - they are genuinely stored and served by BACnetStack_AddElevatorGroupObject (Group_Members is also maintained by BACnetStack_AddLiftOrEscalatorObject as Lift 1/Mauve is added to this group). They are marked accepted only because property-profile-reference.md's generic per-type table does not know about this object-specific host-configuration API and so cannot credit them as stack-served. isGroupOfLifts=true and supportLandingCallStatus=true: Group_Mode and LandingCalls are therefore also enabled (see the Lift's note for how the four F-ELEVATOR list/sequence callbacks are exercised) but property-profile-reference.md's generic Elevator Group table does not mark either 'required', so neither generates a checked row here - Group_Mode is served by GetPropertyEnumerated (normal) and LandingCalls by GetListElevatorGroupLandingCallStatus (no calls outstanding) regardless. NEW vs B-EM: Landing_Call_Control is now writable - BACnetStack_RegisterCallbackSetElevatorGroupLandingCallControl is registered (unlike B-EM, which deliberately left it unregistered), so a WriteProperty commanding a landing call is recorded and read back through GetListElevatorGroupLandingCallStatus. Code-reviewed against the stack's doc comment and confirmed to build/register correctly; NOT independently wire-verified with a real client in this session (BACnetLandingCallStatus's write-side SEQUENCE-CHOICE encoding is not cleanly expressible through the available test-client library) - flagged in the PR rather than assumed

| Group_Members | BACnetARRAY[N] of BACnetObjectIdentifier | stack default, accepted (None known - a read fails with `unknown-property` or an empt) | no |

### Lift 1 "Mauve" - F-ELEVATOR (canonical). property-profile-reference.md's generated Lift table is INCOMPLETE relative to CASBACnetStackDLL.h's own doc comment for BACnetStack_AddLiftOrEscalatorObject (a documentation gap in the stack repo, not a stack API gap): the markdown table omits Car_Position, Car_Moving_Direction, Car_Door_Status, Passenger_Alarm, Out_Of_Service and Fault_Signals entirely, even though the DLL header lists all six as REQUIRED Lift properties. This example serves every one of them regardless, because they are genuinely required by clause 12.59 - Car_Position and Car_Moving_Direction via GetPropertyUnsignedInteger/GetPropertyEnumerated, Car_Door_Status (one door, index 1) via GetPropertyEnumerated with useArrayIndex, Passenger_Alarm and Out_Of_Service via GetPropertyBool, Fault_Signals (empty - no active faults) via the GetListOfEnumerations callback. Status_Flags, Elevator_Group, Group_ID and Installation_ID ARE in the generic table (stack-computed/stack-stored) and are accepted for the same reason as Maroon's. Passenger_Alarm is the AE-N-I-B alarm source: an intrinsic ChangeOfState(bool) algorithm routed to Notification Class 1 (Crimson); it is not writable through any API in this stack (a real installation drives it from hardware), so this example simulates it on a 30-second timer rather than a key or a write - see the file header comment in main.cpp. Optional properties Assigned_Landing_Calls, Registered_Car_Call and Landing_Door_Status are enabled and each exercises one of the four F-ELEVATOR list/sequence callbacks with one demonstration entry

### Escalator 1 "Mint" - F-ELEVATOR. Not a member of Maroon (a group of Lifts, isGroupOfLifts=true) - added with the spec's 'no reference' sentinel (4194303) for Elevator_Group, as clause 12.60.6 allows. Required Operation_Direction (no stack default), Passenger_Alarm and Out_Of_Service are served by the app; the optional Power_Mode and Escalator_Mode are enabled and served too, for a fuller demonstration. Status_Flags/Elevator_Group/Group_ID/Installation_ID are stack-stored, same reasoning as Mauve's

| Passenger_Alarm | Boolean | app | no |

### Positive Integer Value 1 "Turquoise" - not one of the profile's named objects - added explicitly by this application, BEFORE Elevator Group 1 (Maroon), as the object Maroon's Machine_Room_ID references. BACnetStack_AddElevatorGroupObject's own doc comment reads as though the stack creates this object automatically if missing; verified against the running stack, it does not - AddElevatorGroupObject fails outright ('Create the Positive Integer Value object before adding the Elevator Group object') unless the application adds it first. Colour 'Turquoise' per docs/colour-table.md's global positive_integer_value mapping; Present_Value (required, no stack default) is served as an arbitrary plausible room id. Units defaults to no-units (accepted) since a machine-room identifier has none; Out_Of_Service is optional and left at the generic default

### Notification Class 1 "Crimson" - AE-N-I-B / AE-ACK-B / AE-INFO-B. Priority, Ack_Required and Recipient_List are NOT stack DEFAULTS - they are genuinely populated by BACnetStack_AddNotificationClassObject (Priority, Ack_Required) and BACnetStack_AddRecipientToNotificationClass (Recipient_List) at start-up; marked accepted only because property-profile-reference.md's generic per-type table does not know about this object-specific host-configuration API. Unlike B-AAC (AE-CRL-B), Recipient_List is NOT made writable here - AE-CRL-B is not a required BIBB for this profile
